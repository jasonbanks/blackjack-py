# blackjack-py
Simple blackjack game on the command line

This is a fairly simple blackjack game in python - broken down into simple classes for card, hand, player, deck and game.

Bound to be several things that could be done "better"!


*I'm blaming the kids for this one - they're learning python at school and apparently I need to learn it as well to help them with their homework #firstworldproblems*

Learned 90% of the syntax from [w3schools - python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)
